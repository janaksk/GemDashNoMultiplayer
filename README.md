# READ THIS IF YOUR TRYING TO WORK ON YOUR OWN MACHINE

### This is a build of this game I made in a group: https://github.com/janaksk/Info4235Game

### This is a version with no firebase integration or multiplayer, a strictly local version of the game

You should just be editing the code via VS Code or whatever editor of your choosing.

To actually run the project, you just need to boot it as a webserver. For example, heres the easiest way (with python): in terminal, CD to the directory of the project, then just start a local server

```
cd C:\Users\Janak\Desktop\Info4235Game

python -m http.server 8000
```

Then on your browser, you would open:

```

http://localhost:8000/index.html

```
